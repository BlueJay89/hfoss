This is the content repository for the [RIT](https://rit.edu) [Department of Interactive Games and Media](http://igm.rit.edu)
__Humanitarian Free/Open Source Software Course__ (HFOSS). This course is a
__required__ part of the RIT [Academic Minor](https://www.rit.edu/gccis/igm/free-open-source-software-foss-mn) in
[Free/Open Source Software and Free Culture](http://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=50590). 



The directory `ofcourse-content` contains that subset of course-specific content served by an
instance of the [ofCourse](http://github.com/FOSSRIT/ofCourse) courseware, distributed
and maintained separately at [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ofcourse](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ofcourse).

The `assets` directory contains **open educational resources** ([Creative Commons](https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/What_is_OER%3F), [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources),
[opensource.com](https://opensource.com/education/13/4/guide-open-source-education)) either used directly by the course or useful as references or for further reading.

The `docs` directory may eventually contain course content developed
elsewhere (including in the [course wiki](/wiki)) but intended to be served
via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or other, similar static
content hosting system.
