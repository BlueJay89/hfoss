bio: I have a passion for operating system design and programming language design, both of which are done mostly in the realm of FOSS. I hope to contribute to these domains, either as an employee or a volunteer. I'm the current CFO of Machines Never Sleep LLC, a cybersecurity and threat intelligence startup.
